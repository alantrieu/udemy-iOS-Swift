## FlowerClass

This project is an alternative solution to Section 24 of [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) course.

Points to consider:
- Networking and JSON parsing are done natively.
- Download the FlowerClassifier.mlmodel from [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjICf6SNCBMQi0B_-L5MIdw6rJp0?e=Jn7V96) (too large for GitHub). Credits to @[momo-ozawa](https://github.com/momo-ozawa).
- Functionality prioritised over UI.
